## Description & General Info
This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) that serves up a React app that functions like an online bank- albiet a bad one as there is no security included! 

badBank was the portfolio project for the module on front end development as part of MITxPro's Full Stack Web Development course. 

## Languages & Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- React / JSX
- Node.js

## Setup
1. Download or clone the project's repository. 
2. Navigate to the directory of the project from your command line. 
3. Run `npm start` in your commmand line. (Make sure you have Node installed!) This should start the project in a new tab of your default broswer. 
4. Click on the various tabs in the navigation bar to create an account, deposit, or withdraw funds. You can even view all of your transactions on the "All Data" tab.  

## Suggestions for Improvement
- Currently, an account can be created, but a user cannot login to bring up a previously created account because this application does not have a back end for storing user information. A suggestion to improve this application would be adding a backend for that increased functionality.
